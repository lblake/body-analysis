# Body-Analysis Project
I created this website to record my body measurements on a bi-weekly basis as part of my weight training regime. 

The site was created using HTML(Tables) CSS & Javascript. Data is saved using the browser's localstorage.

1: Some fields have a range value, when a value is within the range the field changes to green.<br>
2: When the a value is below or above the range the field changes to red.<br>
3: When a value is entered you will need to use the 'browsers' refresh option to see the field color change.

The website can be viewed here:
